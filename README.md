# Matching models for evacuation and allocation of people in case of disasters and wars

**Artificial Intelligence course**

## Abstract

In this article we analyse an innovative case study in machine learning: matching models for evacuation and allocation of people in case of disasters and wars.

We will briefly introduce matching under preferences and in particular matching model with sizes because it fits very well for our case study. After defining both models we will analyse which algorithms perform better to solve the two matching problems.
