\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    In this article we analyze an important case study in machine learning, the case study was born mainly after two facts:
    the Swiss State Secretariat for Migration recently announced a pilot project for a machine
    learning-based assignment process for refugee resettlement \cite{olbergml}. 
    And the increasing number of terrorist attacks have forced the main emergency lighting companies to produce dynamic lamps 
    that indicate which is the real emergency exit and not only the nearest one.

    In the last period moreover thanks to the increase of natural catastrophes and to the war in Ukraine it becomes more and more 
    necessary to have Matching models to manage in automatic way all these themes, that to the first sight could be very untied 
    between them, but in reality they are extremely tied and similar.
