\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    In this article we analyze an important case study in machine learning, the case study was born mainly after two facts:
    the Swiss State Secretariat for Migration recently announced a pilot project for a machine
    learning-based assignment process for refugee resettlement \cite{olbergml}. 
    And the increasing number of terrorist attacks have forced the main emergency lighting companies to produce dynamic lamps 
    that indicate which is the real emergency exit and not only the nearest one.

    In the last period moreover thanks to the increase of natural catastrophes and to the war in Ukraine it becomes more and more 
    necessary to have Matching models to manage in automatic way all these themes, that to the first sight could be very untied 
    between them, but in reality they are extremely tied and similar.

\subsection{Matching model}

\cite{olbergml,basshuysen,delacretaz_2020}

\subsubsection{Matching model for Asylum}

\cite{olbergml,basshuysen,delacretaz_2020,fernandez} propose implementing a College Admissions (CA)
model on the asylum market. The model differs from the EU model\cite{basshuysen} because it looks not only at the preferences of the states that take people but also at the preferences of the refugees.
it can be said that it is a generalized EU model.

According to the notations of \cite{salles} formally, a CA-instance of a refugee-country matching problem is a four-tuple \((C, R, q, P)\)
(or if treated in a more real way, a 5-tuple \((C, R, q, P, F)\)), where
\(C = \{c_1, ..., c_m\}\) and \(R = \{r_1, ...,r_n\}\) are disjoint sets of \(m\) countries and \(n\) refugees, respectively.
The agents of the market, definition that comes from game theory, are \(a_k \in C\subset R\),
since it can be assumed that \(n >> m\) it is also evident that it is a many-to-one matchings with an upper limit on the many side.
The maximum number of refugees that can be matched to
each country is determined by a vector of quotas \(q = (q_j)_{j\in {1,...,m}} \in \mathbb{N}^m\).
You can also dummy the quotas in this way:  \(q_j = n \forall c_j \in C\).

Afterwards we have, \(P = \{P(c_1), \dots , P(c_m), P(r_1), \dots , P(r_n)\}\) is
a set of preference lists which induces a complete, transitive, and irreflexive preference profile for each
country over the set of refugees and for each refugee over the set of countries. 
Each preference \(P(r_i)\) contains a list of expressed preferences in the format \( c _ { 1 } \succ r _ { i } c _ { 2 } \),
and equivalently for countries' preferences.
And example was illustrated in Table \ref{tab:countries-refugees}.

Finally, there is one last element to consider a list of people who must be together (e.g. a family)
in this case you should be careful to remove duplicate entries of the same people. Also in this case there is a maximum limit to the number of people to keep in the same group.
We then introduce \(F=\{F(f_1), ..., F(f_l)\}\) where \(l\leq n\) and \(F(f_i) = \{r_a, r_b, ...\}\).
In the following, for simplicity, we will consider that \(l=n\) and that \(F(f_i)=\{r_i\}\).

Countries may declare refugees unacceptable, and refugees may declare countries unacceptable, 
hence, there is a subset \(E \subseteq R \times C \times F\) of acceptable refugee-country pairs.
In addition, there is the limitation on the amount of each individual tuple that is acceptable, as a refugee cannot be split into two nations nor can one nation receive more than the maximum allowable quotas.

Denote \( A \left( r _ { i } \right) = \left\{ c _ { j } \mid \left( r _ { i } , c _ { j } \right) \in E \right\} \)
the set of acceptable countries for a given \( r _ { i } \in R \); and equivalently for the countries.
An assignemnt \(M\) is a subset of \(E\) and contains the item \( a _ { k } \in R \cup C \). Obviously a refugee \( r _ { i } \) can be unassigned so \( M \left( r _ { i } \right) = \emptyset \).
Similarly, a country \( c _ { j } \) is
undersubscribed if \( \left| M \left( c _ { j } \right) \right| < q _ { j } \), and full if \( \left| M \left( c _ { j } \right) \right| = q _ { j } \).
It is to remember that the assignment is valid if and only if:
\( \left| M \left( r _ { i } \right) \right| \leq 1 \) for all \( r _ { i } \in R ; \) and
\( \left| M \left( c _ { j } \right) \right| \leq q _ { j } \) for all \( c _ { j } \in C  \).

        \hline Countries & Refugees \\
        \hline\( r_{1} \succ_{c_{1}} r_{2} \succ_{c_{1}} r_{3} \) & \( c_{2} \succ_{1} \) for both \( r_{1} \) and \( r_{2} \) \\
        \( r_{2} \succ_{c_{2}} r_{1} \succ_{c_{2}} r_{3} \) & \( r_{3} \) declares only \( c_{2} \) acceptable \\

\subsubsection{Matching model in case of disaster}

Almost every state has regulations for safety and construction of escape routes (\cite{it-81-2008,uk-1541-2005,usa-1910-1974,cee-654-1989,cee-567-1977}), in general these
regulations can be summarized as: every 60\footnote{60 cm is the minimum size for a person to be 
able to walk without crawling or anything else} cm of corridor/door/staircase can come out around 50-70
\footnote{In american regulations this number is always fixed at 60, in europe this number is more 
variable, usually it is 50, but it can go up to 70 in places of education or offices closed to the public} 
people, rounded to the nearest multiple of 60 cm.

For example, a 120 cm wide escape route can allow the exit of 100-140 people, and a 90 cm 
escape route can allow the exit of 50-70 people.

Another regulation is that from the center of a room to the nearest emergency exit or separate 
fire compartment there can be maximum 60 meters. These two combinations generate a matching model 
very similar and very correlated to that of Asylum.

A CA-instance of a people-exit matching problem is a four-tuple \((E, P, q, N)\)
(or if treated in a more real way, a 5-tuple \((E, P, q, N, F)\)), where
\(E = \{e_1, \dots, e_m\}\) and \(P = \{p_1, \dots,p_n\}\) are disjoint sets of \(m\) people and \(n\) fire exit.
The agents of the market  are \(a_k \in P\subset E\),
since it can be assumed that \(n << m\) it is also evident that it is a many-to-one matchings with an upper limit on the many side.
The maximum number of people that can be matched to
each fire exit is determined by a vector of quotas \(q = (q_j)_{j\in {1,...,m}} \in \mathbb{N}^m\).
You can also dummy the quotas in this way:  \(q_j = n \forall c_j \in C\).

Similarly to before we have, \(P = \{P(e_1), \dots , P(e_m), P(p_1), \dots , P(p_n)\}\) is
a set of preference lists.
Each preference \(P(p_i)\) contains a list of expressed preferences in the format \( e _ { 1 } \succ p _ { i } e _ { 2 } \),
and equivalently for exits' preferences.
 And example was illustrated in Table \ref{tab:people-exit}.

Finally, there is one last element to consider a list of people who must be together (e.g. a family): \(F=\{F(f_1), ..., F(f_l)\}\) where \(l\leq n\) and \(F(f_i) = \{r_a, r_b, ...\}\).
In the following, for simplicity, we will consider that \(l=n\) and that \(F(f_i)=\{r_i\}\).

Fire exit may declare people unacceptable, and people may declare fire exit unacceptable,
hence, there is a subset \(E \subseteq R \times C \times F\) of acceptable people-exit pairs.
In addition, there is the limitation on the amount of each individual tuple that is acceptable, as a people cannot be split into two fire exit nor can one fire exit receive more than the maximum allowable quotas.

Denote \( A \left( r _ { i } \right) = \left\{ p _ { j } \mid \left( e _ { i } , p _ { j } \right) \in E \right\} \)
the set of acceptable people for a given \( p _ { i } \in P \); and equivalently for the people.
An assignemnt \(M\) is a subset of \(E\) and contains the item \( a _ { k } \in R \cup C \). In this case instead it is not possible that \( p _ { i } \) can be unassigned so \( M \left( e _ { i } \right) \neq \emptyset \) although it is possible that for some reason that exit is impracticable.
Just for this reason it is possible to realize models in which you have \(|M \left( e _ { i } \right)| \geq 1\), we omit the analysis of these models.
Similarly, a exit \( e _ { j } \) is
undersubscribed if \( \left| M \left( e _ { j } \right) \right| < q _ { j } \), and full if \( \left| M \left( e _ { j } \right) \right| = q _ { j } \).
It is to remember that the assignment is valid if and only if:
\( \left| M \left( p _ { i } \right) \right| = 1 \) for all \( e _ { i } \in R ; \) and
\( \left| M \left( e _ { j } \right) \right| \leq q _ { j } \) for all \( p _ { j } \in C  \).

\begin{table}[!htb]
    \begin{tabular}{c|c}
        \hline People & Exit \\
        \hline\( p_{1} \succ_{e_{1}} p_{2} \succ_{e_{1}} p_{3} \) & \( e_{2} \succ_{1} \) for both \( p_{1} \) and \( p_{2} \) \\
        \( p_{2} \succ_{e_{2}} p_{1} \succ_{e_{2}} p_{3} \) & \( p_{3} \) declares only \( e_{2} \) within 60 mt \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Table specifying people and exit preferences for
    the study case: There are three group people, \( p _ { 1 } , p _ { 2 } , p _ { 3 } \), and two fire exit \( e _ { 1 } , e _ { 2 } \) with \( p _ { 1 } = 2 \) and \( p _ { 2 } = 1 \).
    When \( a \succ_{e} b \) denotes that \( e \) strictly prefers \( a \) to \( b \).}

\end{table}

\subsubsection{Use of matching models in case of war}

The previous models, as well guessed are very important in case of war: the first model is used just 
to redistribute in a fair way people in case of mass escapes, the second one to optimize the evacuation 
towards bunkers or other safe places in case of attacks and attempts to buildings.
The second model can be widely used to manage the evacuation and moving to safe locations of buildings, hospitals, entire campuses, cities and counties.
In \cite{delacretaz_2020,delacretaz_2019,delacretaz_2016}   there are other example cases of use of this models.

\subsubsection{Similarities and differences between mechanisms}

As we have seen the two previous models are very similar, there are few differences and it is possible to use a common system for the analysis and to realize the matching for both cases.
in fact in \cite{delacretaz_2020} it comes generalized the model to more situations.
