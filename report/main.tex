    \maketitle

    \begin{abstract}
        In this article we analyze an innovative case study in machine learning: matching models for evacuation and allocation of people in case of disasters and wars. This topic has been devised mainly because of two nowadays problems. First, as described by~\citet{olbergml}, the Swiss State Secretariat for Migration recently announced a pilot project for a machine learning-based assignment process for refugee resettlement. Second, the increasing number of terrorist attacks have forced main companies in the emergency lighting sector to produce dynamic lamps to indicate which is the most suitable emergency exit and not only the nearest one.

        Moreover, in the last period, due to the increase of natural catastrophes and to the war in Ukraine it becomes even more necessary to have matching models that manage automatically  these kinds of problems. At first sight they might seem unrelated to each other but in reality they are extremely tied and similar.

    \subsubsection{Matching model for Asylum}\label{matching-model-for-asylum}%
    ~\citet{olbergml,basshuysen,delacretaz_2020,fernandez} propose the implementation of a College Admissions (CA) model for the refugee resettlement matching problem.
    The model differs from the EU model of~\citet{basshuysen} because it doesn't try to optimize only the employment success of a refugee in a certain state but it also takes into account refugees' preferences allowing a trade off between family welfare and overall employment success.
    It can be considered as a generalized EU model.

    According also to the formally notation of~\citet{salles}, a CA-instance of a refugee-country matching problem is a 5-tuple \((C, R, q, P, F)\), where \(C = \{c_1, \dots, c_m\}\) and \(R = \{r_1, \dots, r_n\}\) are disjoint sets of \(m\) countries and \(n\) refugees, respectively.

    Since the distribution of asylum is modelled as a matching problem under preferences, refugees and countries offering asylum make up a two-sided market in which the members of one side are to be distributed over members of the other side.
    So, we can define agents of the market as \(a_k \in C \cup R\).
    
    Note that we are concerned with \textit{many-to-one matchings} since it can be assumed that \(n \gg m\) and each refugee can obtain asylum in at most one country, whereas a given country can accept many refugees. The maximum number of refugees that can be matched to each country is determined by a vector of quotas \(q = (q_j)_j \in \mathbb{N}^m \quad j\in\{1,\dots ,m\}\). There may be no real quotas at all: setting \(q_j = n \quad \forall c_j \in C\) makes them dummies.

    Afterwards, \(P = \{P(c_1), \dots, P(c_m), P(r_1), \dots, P(r_n)\}\) is a set of preference lists which induces a complete, transitive, and irreflexive preference profile for each country over the set of refugees and for each refugee over the set of countries.
    Each preference \(P(r_i)\) contains a list of expressed preferences in the format \(c_1 \succ_{r_i} c_2\), and equivalently for countries' preferences (an example is illustrated in Table~\ref{tab:countries-refugees}).

    In the particular case of refugees' allocation, there is one last element to consider: a list of people who must be together (e.g. a family) and to do so let \(F=\{F(f_1), \dots, F(f_l)\}\) be the list of the groups of refugees, where \(l \leq n\) and \(F(f_i) = \{r_a, r_b, \dots\}\).
    In this case you should be careful to do not exceed the maximum limit to the number of people to keep in the same group and be careful to remove duplicate entries of the same people.
    In the following, for simplicity, we will consider \(l=n\) and \(F(f_i)=\{r_i\}\).

    Countries may declare refugees unacceptable and refugees may declare countries unacceptable, hence, there is a subset \(E \subseteq R \times C \times F\) of acceptable refugee-country pairs.
    In addition, there is the limit on the amount of each individual tuple that is acceptable, because, as a refugee can't be split into two nations nor can one nation receive more than the maximum allowable quotas.
    
    Denote \(A \left( r_i \right) = \left\{ c_j \mid \left( r_i, c_j \right) \in E \right\}\) the set of acceptable countries for a given \(r_i \in R\), and equivalently for the countries.
    
    An assignment \(M\) is a subset of \(E\) and contains the item \(a_k \in R \cup C\).
    Obviously a refugee \(r_i\) can be unassigned so \(M \left( r_i \right) = \emptyset\).
    Similarly, a country \(c_j\) admits applications if \(\left| M \left( c_j \right) \right| < q_j\), and it's full if \(\left| M \left( c_j \right) \right| = q_j\).
    Note that the assignment is valid if and only if \(\left| M \left( r_i \right) \right| \leq 1 \forall r_i \in R\) and \(\left| M \left( c_j \right) \right| \leq q_j \forall c_j \in C\)

        \begin{tabular}{c|c}
            \hline Countries & Refugees \\
            \hline \(r_1 \succ_{c_1} r_2 \succ_{c_1} r_3\) & \(c_2 \succ c_1\) for both \(r_1\) and \(r_2\) \\
            \(r_2 \succ_{c_2} r_1 \succ_{c_2} r_3\) & \(r_3\) declares only \(c_2\) acceptable \\
            \hline

    \subsubsection{Matching model in case of disaster}\label{matching-model-in-case-of-disaster}%
    Almost every state has regulations for safety on construction of escape routes (\citet{it-81-2008,uk-1541-2005,usa-1910-1974,cee-654-1989,cee-567-1977}), these regulations can usually be summarized as: from every 60 cm\footnote{60 cm is the minimum distance for a person to be able to walk without crawling or anything else} of corridor/staircase can come out around 50-70 people\footnote{Regard regulations, in America this number is always fixed at 60, in Europe is more variable, usually it's 50 but it can go up to 70 in education facilities or private offices}.
    For example, a 120 cm wide escape route can allow the exit of 100--140 people, and a 90 cm escape route can allow the exit of 50--70 people.
    %Therefore, it can be rounded to the most intuitive integer number: 60 cm.

    Another regulation is that from the middle of a room to the nearest emergency exit or to the nearest separate fire compartment there can be maximum 60 meters.
    
    These two combinations generate a matching model very similar and very correlated to the one for refugee resettlement.

    A CA-instance of a people-exit matching problem is a 5-tuple \((E, P, q, N, F)\), where \(E = \{e_1, \dots, e_m\}\) and \(P = \{p_1, \dots, p_n\}\) are disjoint sets of \(m\) fire exit and \(n\) people.
    % to revise ---
    The agents of the market are \(a_k \in P \subset E\), since it can be assumed that \(n \ll m\) it is also evident that it is a many-to-one matching with an upper limit on the many side.
    The maximum number of people that can be matched to each fire exit is determined by a vector of quotas \(q = (q_j)_j \in \mathbb{N}^m\), \(j\in {1,...,m}\).
    You can also dummy the quotas in this way:  \(q_j = n \forall c_j \in C\).
    % ---

    Similarly to the matching model for asylum, let \(N = \{N(e_1), \dots, N(e_m), N(p_1), \dots, N(p_n)\}\) be the set of the nearest exit lists.
    Each nearest exit list \(N(p_i)\) contains a list of expressed preferences in the format \(e_1 \succ_{p_i} e_2\), and equivalently for exits' preferences (an example is illustrated in Table~\ref{tab:people-exit}).

    Also in the case of people evacuation, another element to consider is the list of people who must be together (e.g. a family): \(F=\{F(f_1), \dots, F(f_l)\}\) where \(l\leq n\) and \(F(f_i) = \{r_a, r_b, \dots\}\).
    In the following, for simplicity, we will consider that \(l=n\) and that \(F(f_i)=\{r_i\}\).
    
    % simonebastasin ha modificato fino a qui

    Fire exit may declare people unacceptable, and people may declare fire exit unacceptable,
    hence, there is a subset \(C \subseteq E \times P \times F\) of acceptable people-exit pairs.
    In addition, there is the limitation on the amount of each individual tuple that is acceptable, as a people
    cannot be split into two fire exit nor can one fire exit receive more than the maximum allowable quotas.

    Denote \( A \left( e _ { i } \right) = \left\{ p _ { j } \mid \left( e _ { i } , p _ { j } \right) \in C \right\} \)
    the set of acceptable people for a given \( e _ { i } \in E \); and equivalently for the people.
    An assignment \(M\) is a subset of \(C\) and contains the item \( a _ { k } \in E \cup P \).
    In the case of a disaster every person should be able to evacuate, so  \( p _ { i } \) can be unassigned and
    \( M \left( p _ { i } \right) \neq \emptyset \) although it is possible that for some reason that exit is impracticable.
    Just for this reason it is possible to realize models in which you have \(|M \left( e _ { i } \right)| \geq 1\)
    i.e. assign to each user a second emergency exit, so that if the first is impracticable the second can be used.
    This strategy is to be avoided, and it is better to have a system of detection of impassable exits.
    We omit the analysis of these models.
    Similarly, an exit \( e _ { j } \) is  under subscribed if
    \( \left| M \left( e _ { j } \right) \right| < q _ { j } \), and full if
    \( \left| M \left( e _ { j } \right) \right| = q _ { j } \).
    It is to remember that the assignment is valid if and only if:
    \( \left| M \left( p _ { i } \right) \right| = 1 \) for all \( p _ { i } \in P ; \) and
    \( \left| M \left( e _ { j } \right) \right| \leq q _ { j } \) for all \( e _ { j } \in E  \).

    \subsubsection{Use of matching models in case of war}\label{use-of-matching-model-in-case-of-war}%
    The previous models (in~\ref{matching-model-for-asylum},~\ref{matching-model-in-case-of-disaster}), as well guessed
    are very important in case of war: the first model is used just
    to redistribute in a fair way people in case of mass escapes, the second one to optimize the evacuation
    towards bunkers or other safe places in case of attacks and attempts to buildings.
    The second model can be widely used to manage the evacuation and moving to safe locations of buildings, hospitals,
    entire campuses, cities and counties.
    In~\citet{delacretaz_2020,delacretaz_2019,delacretaz_2016}   there are other example cases of use of this models.

    \subsubsection{Similarities and differences between mechanisms}\label{similarities-and-differences-between-mechanisms}

    As we have seen the two previous models are very similar, there are few differences and it is possible to use a
    common system for the analysis and to realize the matching for both cases.
    in fact in~\citet{delacretaz_2020} the model has been generalized to be adepted in more situations.

    \subsubsection{Compliance with Ethical Principles}\label{compliance-with-ethical-principles}~\citet{basshuysen}

    ethicality in the case of the use of algorithms such as machine learning and error learning

    the use of machine learning algorithms is ethically flawed in all cases where the salvation of people is associated
    with a Bayesian algorithm since it is a probability that decides the salvation or death of people.


    \subsection{Conclusion}

    we have seen two models very adaptable to endless emergency situations and in case of disasters, we have also seen
    the main models of resolution and we have also seen how they can help people in case of disasters and war
