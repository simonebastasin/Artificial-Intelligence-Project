\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    In this article we analyze an important case study in machine learning, the case study was born mainly after two facts:
    the Swiss State Secretariat for Migration recently announced a pilot project for a machine
    learning-based assignment process for refugee resettlement \cite{olbergml}. 
    And the increasing number of terrorist attacks have forced the main emergency lighting companies to produce dynamic lamps 
    that indicate which is the real emergency exit and not only the nearest one.

    In the last period moreover thanks to the increase of natural catastrophes and to the war in Ukraine it becomes more and more 
    necessary to have Matching models to manage in automatic way all these themes, that to the first sight could be very untied 
    between them, but in reality they are extremely tied and similar.

\subsubsection{Matching model in case of disaster}

Almost every state has regulations for safety and construction of escape routes, in general these 
regulations can be summarized as: every 60\footnote{60 cm is the minimum size for a person to be 
able to walk without crawling or anything else} cm of corridor/door/staircase can come out around 50-70
\footnote{In american regulations this number is always fixed at 60, in europe this number is more 
variable, usually it is 50, but it can go up to 70 in places of education or offices closed to the public} 
people, rounded to the nearest multiple of 60 cm.

For example, a 120 cm wide escape route can allow the exit of 100-140 people, and a 90 cm 
escape route can allow the exit of 50-70 people.

Another regulation is that from the center of a room to the nearest emergency exit or separate 
fire compartment there can be maximum 60 meters. These two combinations generate a matching model 
very similar and very correlated to that of Asylum.

\subsubsection{Similarities and differences between mechanisms}

\subsubsection{Use of matching models in case of war}

The previous models, as well guessed are very important in case of war: the first model is used just 
to redistribute in a fair way people in case of mass escapes, the second one to optimize the evacuation 
towards bunkers or other safe places in case of attacks and attempts to buildings.
