   In this article we analyse an innovative case study in machine learning: matching models for evacuation and allocation of people in case of disasters and wars.
    
    We will briefly introduce matching under preferences and in particular \textit{matching model with sizes} because it fits very well for our case study. After defining both models we will analyse which algorithms perform better to solve the two matching problems.
