\subsection{Use of matching models in case of war}\label{use-of-matching-model-in-case-of-war}%
Previous models argue topics that can be very useful in case of war. First model, for mass escapes, can redistribute in a quick and fair way people to safer countries.

Second model, during alarms for attacks, can optimally manage:
\begin{itemize}
    \item evacuation of people from buildings at risk of attack;
    \item shelter of people towards bunkers or other safe places.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Similarities and differences between mechanisms}\label{similarities-and-differences-between-mechanisms}

As we have seen the two previous models are very similar, there are few differences so it is possible to use a
common system for the analysis and to realize the matching for both cases.
In fact ~\citet{delacretaz_2020} formulated a generalized model that can be adepted in more situations.
