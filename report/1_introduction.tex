The topics covered in this paper have been chosen mainly for two nowadays problems. First, as described by \citet{olbergml}, the Swiss State Secretariat for Migration recently announced a pilot project for a machine learning-based assignment process for refugee resettlement. Second, the increasing number of wars and terrorist attacks have highlighted the necessity to intelligently manage an effective evacuation and a quick arrive of people to safe places.

Moreover, in the last period, due to the increase of natural catastrophes and to the war in Ukraine it becomes even more necessary to have matching models that manage automatically  these kinds of problems. At first sight they might seem unrelated to each other but in reality they are extremely tied and similar.
