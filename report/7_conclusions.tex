\section{Conclusion}
We have seen two models very adaptable to endless emergency situations and in case of disasters.
The use of stable matching and machine model thus ensures better maching more stable and thus helping people more which can be used in a large number of contexts, in all situations where people need to be sorted in certain places.
Combine efforts to improve a single model that can be reused for many purposes, makes it possible to reduce effort and build increasingly stable matching resolution algorithms and models.

It is also important to consider that the use of machine learning is reduced to calculating a value \(\pi\), this value could be in contrast with COMs as it could be thought to lead to situations where it is a poorly trained algorithm that determines the life or death of people, but if you analyze how the value \(\pi\) was used it is nothing more than the transformation of a list of preferences into a machine learning algorithm, which can fail.
